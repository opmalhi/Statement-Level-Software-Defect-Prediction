# SLDeep
This project focuses on detecting coding errors in student assignments and identifying the most difficult-to-understand parts for teachers to address in class. Inspired by a research paper, we expanded the error categories from 3 to 5 using real student data. Our goal is to help educators pinpoint common coding challenges, making classroom instruction more efficient and targeted.
